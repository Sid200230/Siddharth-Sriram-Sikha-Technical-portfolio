              The project aimed to develop a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system capable of answering questions related to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Language Technologies Institute (LTI). These topics require domain-specific knowledge that standard chatbots lack. The RAG system was designed to overcome these limitations by compiling and leveraging documents relevant to CMU and LTI.
            </p>
            <p>
              The development of the RAG system involved extensive data preparation and annotation. This phase combined automated tools with manual efforts to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the compiled documents. The system incorporated both a multi-query retriever and a re-ranker, enhancing its ability to provide precise and comprehensive answers. This approach was compared against models using only a retriever or no retriever within the RAG framework.
            </p>
            <p>
              The RAG system achieved a significant improvement in performance, as evidenced by its F1 score of 0.4161. This score was 1.57 times better than that of a 'retriever' only model and three times better than a 'no retriever' only model. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating both a multi-query retriever and a re-ranker into the RAG system, demonstrating its capability to handle domain-specific questions with higher accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The success of the RAG system in answering CMU and LTI-related questions underscores the importance of domain knowledge in developing specialized conversational AI systems. The combination of automated tools and manual efforts in data preparation proved instrumental in achieving improved performance metrics. The integration of a multi-query retriever and a re-ranker further enhanced the system's ability to generate accurate responses, showcasing the potential of such approaches in addressing domain-specific information retrieval and generation challenges.

              Nowadays, large language models have become increasingly prominent in various fields due to their ability to generate reasoning like humans. One of the largest open-sourced language models in the current market is LLAMA2, and I undertook a project to develop a minimalistic version of LLAMA2 to gain a deeper understanding of its architecture. In this project, I focused on developing the core components of the LLAMA2 model, with a specific emphasis on positional encodings using Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) due to their superior performance compared to conventional sinusoidal embeddings as described in the paper “Attention is all you need.” The aim was to evaluate the model's performance through zero-shot prompting on two datasets: SST (Sentiment Analysis) and CFIMDB (Content Filtering for IMDB reviews).
            </p>
            <p>
              First, I implemented the core components of the LLAMA2 model, focusing on its architecture and incorporating Rotary Positional Embeddings for positional encodings. I then conducted zero-shot prompting experiments on both the SST dataset and the CFIMDB dataset. For evaluation, I measured the model's performance using Dev (development) and Test accuracy scores.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, I fine-tuned the language model using the TinyStories dataset, which consists of machine-generated children’s stories. During fine-tuning, the model was trained on this domain-specific dataset to adapt its language generation capabilities accordingly. I evaluated the fine-tuned model's performance on both the SST and CFIMDB datasets, again measuring Dev and Test accuracy scores for each.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Rotary Positional Embeddings in enhancing the performance of language models like LLAMA2, particularly when fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets. The substantial improvement in accuracy scores post-fine-tuning highlights the importance of dataset adaptation for achieving better model performance in specific tasks. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of language model architectures and the impact of positional encodings on their functionality and performance across different domains.

              Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical technology in robotics and autonomous systems, enabling them to navigate and map unknown environments in real time. However, the diversity of SLAM implementations often makes it challenging to select an appropriate framework for specific applications. In this paper, we address this issue by developing a stereo Visual Odometry SLAM system from scratch using Python. Our focus is on understanding and implementing key components such as the frontend, backend, and loop closure for accurate mapping and localization. We evaluate our system on the KITTI odometry dataset to assess its performance and identify areas for enhancement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our study begins with a detailed explanation of the theoretical foundations of SLAM, including concepts like Visual Odometry (VO), frontend feature matching, backend optimization, and loop closure detection. We then proceed to construct our SLAM system using Python, ensuring a clear understanding of each component's functionality and integration within the system. The KITTI odometry dataset, particularly sequence 00, serves as our evaluation benchmark, allowing us to test the system's performance under real-world conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The evaluation of our SLAM system on the KITTI dataset reveals crucial insights into its performance and limitations. We observed that the amount of noise added to the odometry factors significantly impacts the backend optimization process. Too little noise prevents the optimizer from finding the optimal solution, while excessive noise leads to divergence. Through iterative testing, we identified optimal parameter values for noise, stride, and thresholds, improving the system's accuracy. Additionally, we compared the performance of different optimizers, noting variations in runtime and effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, our study presents a comprehensive framework for implementing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using Python, tailored for stereo Visual Odometry applications. By evaluating the system on the KITTI odometry dataset and addressing key challenges such as noise optimization and backend performance, we contribute to the ongoing research in SLAM technology. Future work will focus on further refining the system's accuracy and exploring real-time operation possibilities.
