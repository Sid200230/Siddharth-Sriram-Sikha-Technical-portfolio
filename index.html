            <p>
             I am a highly motivated Mechanical Engineer with a strong foundation in design, simulation, and manufacturing. As I approach the completion of my Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, I bring hands-on experience in the Oil & Gas, Energy sectors via internships at Slb and Tecumseh Products. My work involved optimizing complex product assemblies for hardware testing, conducting FEA for structural and thermal analysis, and streamlining manufacturing processes. Proficient in CAD, FEA, DFM, and programming (Python, MATLAB), I am driven by a passion for solving engineering challenges and delivering innovative, efficient solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
             I enjoy playing table tennis and basketball in my free time. I am enthusiastic about connecting with fellow industry professionals who share a passion for innovative engineering solutions in design, manufacturing, and sustainability. I am eager to engage in discussions and networking opportunities to explore emerging trends in mechanical engineering, such as advanced manufacturing processes, thermal systems, and renewable energy technologies. Ultimately, my ambition is to contribute to at least one game-changing project that pushes the boundaries of engineering and makes a meaningful impact on the industry and society.

            <p>
              During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, our team developed an innovative Smart Face Shield with Tesla Valve to enhance personal and environmental safety. The project aimed to address limitations in traditional masks by creating a design that protected both the user and their surroundings. Leveraging advanced mechanical design tools and simulation techniques, we conceptualized, prototyped, and optimized this device for maximum efficiency and usability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using Autodesk Fusion 360, we designed a modular face shield with an integrated Tesla valve to regulate airflow, ensuring effective filtration. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed in ANSYS Fluent to optimize the valve's flow dynamics for seamless inhalation and controlled exhalation, reducing air contamination risks. The design also incorporated 3D printing technologies, using PLA material, which provided sustainability and reusability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our solution included a multi-layer filtration system: ethanol-coated PLA, a Tesla valve, and synthetic microfiber. This design achieved improved air filtration while maintaining user comfort through proper ventilation. Post-design, the product was rigorously tested on users across age groups, validating its functionality and effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              By collaborating on challenges such as airflow optimization, material durability, and manufacturability, we enhanced the face shield’s reliability. This project not only demonstrated my expertise in CAD modeling, CFD simulations, and additive manufacturing but also highlighted my ability to innovate under real-world constraints. The final product addressed critical health and safety needs while aligning with sustainable engineering practices, showcasing a blend of technical precision and user-focused design.

By designing an innovative scuffing rig, performing experimental vibration analysis, and deriving actionable insights, the project provided a comprehensive solution to improve packaging resilience. 
            Design and Development:
            The project began with the conceptualization of a scuffing rig to simulate real-world vibrations experienced during transport. Using SolidWorks, I designed two iterations of the rig, refining its functionality after identifying friction and motion issues in the initial prototype. To improve stability and accuracy, I incorporated springs and bushings sourced from McMaster-Carr in the second iteration, which eliminated wobbling and ensured smooth vertical motion. The prototype was fabricated using Ultimaker 5S 3D printers and optimized with Cura software, showcasing advanced manufacturing techniques and material efficiency.          
            <p>
            Experimental Analysis:
            With the rig complete, I conducted vibration testing using a Lansmont Saver 9X30 data logger to replicate real-world conditions. By analyzing vibration frequencies between 0-300 Hz, I identified the critical range of 3-40 Hz for optimal scuffing tests, significantly reducing testing time without sacrificing accuracy. I processed the test data using MATLAB, employing Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to quantify scuffing percentage through image degradation analysis. 
            <p>
            Results and Insights:
            The testing revealed key vibration parameters contributing to scuffing, leading to recommendations for optimized packaging designs. By narrowing the testing frequency and refining material choices, the project provided a scalable approach for reducing damage during transportation. This work not only highlighted my expertise in design, analysis, and simulation but also underscored my ability to integrate advanced tools and techniques to solve practical engineering challenges.

              This project explored the innovative conversion of reaction-diffusion patterns into 3D printed textured boards for use in haptic experiments. By combining advanced computational modeling, CAD design, and 3D printing, the project bridged the gap between digital pattern generation and tangible textures, achieving significant progress in tactile research.            </p>
            <p>
              The core of the project lay in developing two distinct methodologies for converting intricate 2D diffusion patterns into 3D textures:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) Python-Based Contour Detection: Using the Gray-Scott model, patterns were generated and refined with scikit-image’s contour detection algorithm and the Ramer–Douglas-Peucker algorithm for smoother curves. The contours were transformed into 3D models using Fusion 360 Automate API, which included edge filleting and the addition of a base to enhance structural integrity. The final outputs were exported as STL files for 3D printing.
            </p>
            <p>
              2) MATLAB-Based Mesh Generation: This method utilized MATLAB’s meshz and Delaunay triangulation techniques to create 3D models from the diffusion patterns. The STL files generated were further refined in Fusion 360, ensuring accurate surface representation and base integration.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 3D models were printed using a resin printer, followed by meticulous polishing with grit sandpaper and resin spraying to enhance transparency and tactile clarity. The textured boards, fabricated at a cost-effective $15 each, met the requirements for haptic experiments: visual transparency, modifiable textures, and scalability for various setups. This project demonstrated proficiency in Python, MATLAB, Fusion 360, and 3D printing, along with expertise in reaction-diffusion modeling and surface engineering. The successful implementation highlights the capability to integrate computational design with physical manufacturing, paving the way for advancements in tactile research and experimental design.

              The project began with extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning to ensure data quality and reliability. Various data preprocessing techniques were employed to prepare the dataset for machine learning model implementation. The use of PySpark facilitated efficient data processing, while PostgreSQL aided in managing the dataset. Scikit-learn was utilized for implementing machine learning models, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools were leveraged for model training and deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              After performing EDA, data cleaning, and implementing machine learning models, the system demonstrated robustness, accuracy, and scalability in predicting and classifying network intrusions. The combination of PySpark, PostgreSQL, Scikit-learn, and GCP tools played a crucial role in achieving efficient data processing, model training, and deployment.
